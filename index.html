        <p id="trivandrum-history">
            According to the Sangam classic Purananuru,<br> the Chera king Senkuttuvan conquered the lands<br> between Kanyakumari and the Himalayas.Lacking<br> worthy enemies, he besieged the sea by throwing his<br> spear into it. According to the 17th-century<br><br> Hindu mythology work Keralolpathi, the lands of<br> Kerala were recovered from the sea by the axe-wielding<br> warrior sage Parasurama, the sixth avatar of Vishnu<br> (hence, Kerala is also called Parasurama Kshetram<br> 'The Land of Parasurama' in Hindu mythology).<br> Parasurama threw his axe across the sea, and the<br> water receded as far as it reached. According to<br> legend, this new area of land extended from Gokarna to<br> Kanyakumari. The land which rose from sea was<br> filled with salt and unsuitable for habitation; so<br> Parasurama invoked the Snake King Vasuki, who spat<br> holy poison and converted the soil into fertile<br> lush green land. Out of respect, Vasuki and all snakes<br> were appointed as protectors and guardians of the<br> land. P. T. Srinivasa Iyengar theorised, that<br> Senguttuvan may have been inspired by the Parasurama<br> legend, which was brought by early Aryan settlers.]<br>

Another much earlier Puranic character associated with<br> Kerala is Mahabali, an Asura and a prototypical<br> just king, who ruled the earth from Kerala. He won the<br> war against the Devas, driving them into exile. The<br> Devas pleaded before Lord Vishnu, who took his fifth incarnation as Vamana and pushed Mahabali down to<br> netherworld to placate the Devas. There is a belief<br> that, once a year during the Onam festival,<br> Mahabali returns to Kerala. The Matsya Purana, among<br> the oldest of the 18 Puranas, uses the<br><br> setting for the story of Matsya, the first<br>arnation of Vishnu, and Manu, the first man and the<br> king of the region.<br>
